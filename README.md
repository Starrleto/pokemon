Pokemon React Rebuild
Create a Pokedex in React

Peer Review: Jerrod Packard
Peer Review comments: Your site looks nice! A few things are missing, but you have a great foundation. I noticed the random feature isn't working just yet, and if I type a name or a number into the input field and click the random button, it performs the search just like the search button does. The way you have the moves waterfall down the bottom of the page is interesting, but it might be better if it just formed a little paragraph rather than stretching so far down. I like the layout and I like the way you have the types listed out with the little pill icons, those are a nice touch. Nice job! Don't forget to limit the search to pokemon with an ID of 649 or less!
